Data warehousing and business Intelligence project  
Analyzing large and complex datasets using SQL, without the need for a database administrator or the 
need to set up and maintain complex infrastructures is one of the key aspects of business intelligence. Big 
Query is a fully managed, cloud native data warehouse that enables SQL queries using the processing 
power of Google's infrastructure, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and business intelligence. 
KNIME (Konstanz Information Miner) is an open-source data analytics platform that allows users to create 
data pipelines, analyze data and create reports and visualizations. It also features a wide range of built-in 
data processing, data visualization, and machine learning nodes, making it a powerful tool for data 
exploration, data preparation, and modeling. Data Bears will leverage KNIME, integrate Knime to extract 
data from various data sets and analyze it according to business logic. Eventually, we will visualize it, to 
tell data stories.
